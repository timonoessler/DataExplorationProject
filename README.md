## Project summary
This is a data exploration project with a machine learning component. It deals with a data set that contains various attributes of apples. The goal of the evaluation is to predict the quality of the apples based on these attributes. Machine learning is used to recognize patterns and correlations in the data and to develop a predictive model that can determine whether an apple is of good or poor quality. Various machine learning methods are used to maximize the accuracy of the predictions and intelligently assess the quality of the apples.
